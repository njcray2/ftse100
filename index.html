<h2>This simple web site displays sets of stocks in a cube with Q V M axes.</h2>
Choose a stock set from the list below to get started.

There will be a pause before the page appears while the data is compiled into a webGL object.

<h2>Some basic help on how to use these plots</h2>
<p>
Just click on the link above for the stock set you are interested in.
<p>
There will be a pause before the page appears while the data is compiled into a webGL object - so be patient initially.
<p><hr>
The page is easiest to use in a "landscape" aspect ratio.
<p>
On a desktop maximise the window, and on a phone or small device, rotate the screen into the 'landscape' orientation.
<p><hr>
Once it appears, there is a 3D cube on the left and a set of controls on the right.
<p>
Select a stock from the collection available and press 'play' to see its motion in QVM state space as time elapses.
<p>
You can also move the slider to a time of your choosing while the 'play/pause' button is in the 'pause' state.
<p><hr>
To help you get your bearings, the eight Stock Rank styles are used to label the eight corners of the cube.
<p>
On a desktop, you can zoom into the view using the mouse scroll wheel, and you can move the cube to change the view by dragging it with the mouse.
<p>
On tablets and other touch devices this might not work and you will need to use the 'rotate' button or the slider near it to change the view of the cube.
<p><hr>
The stocks you select will leave a trail behind which is about 1.5 years long and the current date is shown next to the slider.
You can either allow it to play, or press 'pause' and then use the slider to move to any date you like.
<p>
The size of the sphere representing a stock is proportional to its market cap. You can rarely see this change, but AAL is a good example of a stock which grows noticeably over the time period of the animation.
<p>
When there is no data (my database is full of holes, especially for very large stocks) the sphere will display in grey until the animation reaches a date where there is data again.
<p><hr>
If you select 'show all stocks' then all the stocks are shown together, without the vapour trails. This view can be useful for getting some kind of overall impression about how particular classes of stocks behave.
